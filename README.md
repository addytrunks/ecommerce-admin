## Ecommerce Admin
A Next-JS web app built with typescript and shadcn ui.

Manage your Ecommerce store with this admin web app.

The salient features of this app are:
  1. Dashboard(with a graph!)
  2. CRUD Functionalities(Store,Billboard,category,color,size,products & order)
  3. Theme Toggling(Light/Dark)
  4. View API routes for specific entities
  5. Clerk User authentication & authorization
  6. Details of each entity(category,billboard...) in a user friendly way

Important concepts that I have learnt through this project:
  1. Typescript
  2. React `useForm` with `zod`
  3. Prisma(Creating Schemas, Filtering and Querying)
  4. Clerk - authentication & authorization
  5. Stripe integration
  6. Fixing CORS Error when fetching from an external source
  7. State management using `zustand`
